# Learn Go With Tests

[Learn Go With Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) is a resource for people to learn the Go programming language, and to build a solid foundation in test driven development.

## What am I doing with this?

It's been a while since I've written more than a trivial amount of code in Go, and even longer since I've really brushed up on my test writing ability.

I've decided to carve out some time to actually practice some TDD. This repo will serve as a place to track my progress as I work my way through it.
