# Discipline

- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass

This loop ensures all tests are relevant, and helps ensure you design good software by refactoring with the safety of tests.

> Seeing the test fail is an important check.
